== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with ThemeMove's themes on ThemeForest? =
No. It only works with the themes on WordPress.org and [ThemeMove Club](https://thememove.com).

= Where can I find my license keys to activate the theme? =
[You can find your license keys here](https://thememove.com/dashboard/licenses/)

= I don't receive the theme update message =
We use transient to save the theme information on your site. It will be automatically refreshed after 1 day.
You can try to clear those update caches by going to *Dashboard > Updates*. If you still don't see the update message, please try to use [this plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/artiss-transient-cleaner/) to delete all update caches.

= I can't import demo data because of the system requirement =
The importer requires minimum PHP configuration as follow:
- max_execution_time 300
- memory_limit 256MB
- post_max_size 100MB
- upload_max_filesize 100MB

You can verify your PHP configuration limits in the *System Info* tab in *ThemeMove Core > Tools*. You can do this on your own, or contact your web host and ask them to adjust those configurations.

= I want to ignore all import issues. Is it possible? =
Yes, it's. Please add the code below to the functions.php file in your child theme

`
add_filter( 'tmc_ignore_import_issues', '__return_true' );
`

*Note: We do not guarantee the demo data will be imported properly when you ignore the import issues*

= I see a message when import the demo data: 'Could not download the media package. The URL is not defined'. What should I do? =
Please contact our support staff in the [support forums](https://thememove.ticksy.com/) or start your own topic.
He will send you the media package and give you an instruction to install it on your server.

= After importing the demo content, my Media Library image files weren't showing up as proper thumbnails â€“ it seemed as if the thumbnails were missing. =
You should use [this plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).
